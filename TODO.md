add config or "more" button
    vertical three dot [...] button?
    could enable display of more UI 
        flicker settings
        sound ?
        show delete and order buttons

add app welcome ui and user-agent check to show its intended for use on kindles

add save functionality using url params and kindle bookmarks

add custom modal instead of alert() window which stops the runtime?

use jsdoc types strings (;-D) 

bugs
    when a timer is running, the others can still be "triggered", but it fucks everything up
        the other timers should be disabled
